  zsh \
  zsh-autosuggestions \
  zsh-completions \
  zsh-history-substring-search \
  zsh-syntax-highlighting \
  zsh-theme-powerlevel10k \
  pkgfile

- Update `pkgfile` database so to be able to recommend packages
  ```
  pkgfile -u
  ```

- Clone the repository to your local machine
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mh-firouzjah/zsh-config.git ~/.config/zsh
  ```

- Copy the `.zshrc` file to your home directory
  ```
  cp zsh-config/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
  ```

### Automatic Installation For Arch(Arch-based)

  ```
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mh-firouzjah/zsh-config/master/install.sh)
  ```

### Optional

```
sudo cp ~/.config/zsh/rootzshrc /root/.zsh
```

### Finally

- Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

### Exception

- If powerlevel10k is asking for and generating a new prompt interface
different from what is manjaro's default zsh theme,
copy `./p10k.zsh` to the home directory of appropriate user.
  ```
  cp ./p10k.zsh ~/.p10k.zsh
  ```

- If your terminal does not support `p10k.zsh` try the `./p10k-portable.zsh`
